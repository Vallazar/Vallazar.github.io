        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>Transportation to the island: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that 
            docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate 
            small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be 
            able to land on the island within the next few years.</p>
        <p>Transportation on the island: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses 
            serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local 
            rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are 
            required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding 
            Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</p>
